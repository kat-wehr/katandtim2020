We are thankful to have most of the things we need to go about our daily lives, but we look forward to beginning this new life of commitment with a shared goal. Growing up, RV camping was the primary way to vacation in Katrina's family. We would love to continue this tradition by purchasing our own RV to travel the country with our dogs in tow. In our registry you will find a small selection of items to help us get our RV life started!
