### How We Met
In the summer of 2015, Katrina was beginning a new job at Penn State, while Tim was preparing to start his Master's program in Ecology at Penn State. More than a year would pass before we met and had our first date at Local Whiskey in State College on October 10, 2016. We dated for two years - traveling to visit Katrina's cousin in Vermont and ski, vacationing with Tim's family in Ocean City NJ, attending concerts, visiting craft beweries, hiking around State College, and accompanying each other on work trips around the country. We both enrolled in doctoral programs in fall 2018 - Tim in Ecology and Katrina in Learning, Design, & Technology. 

On November 9, 2018, Tim and Katrina were enjoying drinks with friends in downtown State College. As we walked back to the car, we detoured past Old Main, where Tim popped the question. The next day, we enjoyed a surprise tailgate party with friends and family before Penn State beat Wisconsin in perhaps the coldest game of the season. 

We look forward to celebrating our commitment to each other with our families and closest friends on the fourth anniversary of our first date, October 10, 2020.
