### How We Met
Tim enrolled in the Ecology graduate program at Penn State to work on his Master's and moved to State College in summer 2015. 
Katrina left her job at Drexel and began working at Penn State in summer of 2015. 
More than a year passed before we had our first date at Local Whiskey in State College on October 10, 2016. Tim planned to graduate in 2017, and moved in with Katrina in the summer of 2017 after getting a full time job at Penn State. He successfully defended his Master's thesis in fall 2017 and graduated that December. 
We dated for another year - traveling to visit Katrina's cousin in Vermont and ski, vacationing with Tim's family in Ocean City NJ, attending concerts, hiking around State College, and accompanying each other on work trips around the country. We both enrolled in doctoral programs in fall 2018 - Tim in Ecology and Katrina in Learning, Design, & Technology. 
On November 9, 2018, Tim and Katrina were enjoying drinks with friends in downtown State College. As we walked back to the car, we detoured past Old Main, where Tim popped the question. The next day, we enjoyed a tailgate party with friends and family before Penn State beat Wisconsin in perhaps the coldest game of the season. 
We look forward to celebrating our commitment to each other with our families and closest friends on the fourth anniversary of our first date, October 10, 2020.
